Farmers' Market Expansion\n","<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n","<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n","<ol>\n","<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n","<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n","<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n","</ol>\n","<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n","<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown
