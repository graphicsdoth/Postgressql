Farmers' Market Expansion\n<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/463543c8c38957ca5b95d93b02f2cb1bec53334f/diagram.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\npostgresql:///groceries\n\nwith dairy_sale19 as \n(select cast(p2.month as integer), count(p2.purchase_id) as \"total_dsales\"\nfrom purchases_2019 p2\ninner join categories c on (p2.purchase_id = c.purchase_id)\nwhere c.category in ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\ngroup by month\norder by month),\n\ntotal_sale19 as \n(select cast(p2.month as integer), count(p2.purchase_id) as \"total_sales\"\nfrom purchases_2019 p2\ninner join categories c on (p2.purchase_id = c.purchase_id)\ngroup by month\norder by month),\n\ndairy_sale20 as \n(select cast(left((right(p2.fulldate,5)),2) as integer) as month, count(p2.purchaseid) as \"total_dsales\"\nfrom purchases_2020 p2\ninner join categories c on (p2.purchaseid = c.purchase_id)\nwhere c.category in ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\ngroup by month\norder by month),\n\ntotal_sale20 as \n(select cast(left((right(p2.fulldate,5)),2) as integer) as month, count(p2.purchaseid) as \"total_sales\"\nfrom purchases_2020 p2\ninner join categories c on (p2.purchaseid = c.purchase_id)\ngroup by month\norder by month)\n\n\nselect a.month, b.total_sales, round(((c.total_dsales * 100.0) /  d.total_sales),2) as \"market_share\", (round(((c.total_dsales * 100.0) /  d.total_sales),2) -
